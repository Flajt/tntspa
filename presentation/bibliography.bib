abstract = {We address the problem of automatically generating concise factual questions from linguistically complex sentences in reading ma- terials. We discuss semantic and pragmatic issues that appear in com- plex sentences, and then we present an algorithm for extracting simpli- ed sentences from appositives, subordinate clauses, and other construc- tions. We conjecture that our method is useful as a preliminary step in a larger question generation process. Experimental results indicate that our method is more suitable for factual question generation applications than an alternative text compression algorithm.},
