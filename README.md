> This is the repository I created for recording the code, scripts, data, outputs, and papers used or written during the time of my master thesis writing.

**The thesis is already finished. (8th January 2019)** I will gradually upload everything (hopefully before March 2019) and update the instructions for usage.

## Data

Data files are too large to upload here. I will upload them somewhere else (unsettled).
