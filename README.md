# TNTSPA (Translating Natural language To SPArql)

*Author: Xiaoyu Yin*

This is the repository I created for recording the codes, scripts, data, outputs, and papers written or used during the time of my master thesis writing.

**The thesis is currently ongoing. (July 2018 - December 2018 (expected))** The repository will be continuously updated until the author completes the defense.

## Data

Data files are too large to upload here. I will upload them some other place (unsettled).
