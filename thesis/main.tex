\acknowledgments{

I would first like to thank my thesis supervisor Dr. Dagmar Gromann. I could not have completed this thesis without her encouragement and supervision. She kept communicating with me on every aspects of my thesis and offered numerous helpful suggestions. I am also deeply motivated by her professionalism and positive attitudes. I just feel so lucky and grateful to be her student.

I would then like to thank Dr. Dmitrij Schlesinger as the second reader of this thesis, and I am gratefully indebted to him for his very valuable comments and help on the experiments.

I would also like to acknowledge Wenyue Dong for her company throughout the time of my thesis writing. She has given me the biggest support.

Finally, I would like to thank my family who taught me to be who I am and supported me to finish this master study.

The Semantic Web is an extension to the traditional Web based on a set of technologies to embed semantics in newly built or existing web contents. Linked Data is one of the most developed applications of the Semantic Web that allows these contents with semantics to be connected. Through linked datasets such as DBpedia, people have access to an enormous unified knowledge network that links the data and information stored in arbitrary locations in the world. However, there is an evident gap between the natural language used by the humans and the language such as SPARQL for querying this kind of knowledge network. 

Neural machine translation (NMT) is an emerging area where neural networks in the field of deep learning are utilized to translate between natural languages automatically and have achieved great improvements over traditional methods. It has been recently shown that the approaches in this area can also be used to translate natural language to SPARQL. However, due to lack of high-quality datasets, few experiments on this task have been done so far and the effects have not been fully examined yet. In this thesis, we chose 3 already published datasets and 3 categories of state-of-the-art NMT approaches, and carried out 40 experiments to investigate the benefits and drawbacks of applying NMT models on the task of translating natural language to SPARQL.
